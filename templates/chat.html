      <p class="context-desc">
        {% if bot == 'socratic' %}
          “The unexamined life is not worth living.”<br>Explore your beliefs through questioning.
          <p class="context-desc">Imagine Socrates in a sunny Athenian courtyard, guiding friends with simple, sharp questions—“What is justice?” “How can you be sure?”—like a gardener tending to hidden ideas, helping them bloom into clarity.</p>
          <p class="context-desc">Today, that same spirit lives on in lively classroom talks, thoughtful therapy sessions, and spirited law debates. By welcoming “I don’t know,” we turn curiosity into our compass, sailing toward a life lived on purpose and with wonder.</p>
          <p class="context-desc2"><i>If you’re struggling with mental health, contact your local authority or crisis services. Please do not share personal or sensitive information.</i></p>
        {% elif bot == 'rogerian' %}
          “What is most personal is most universal.”<br>Reflective, empathic listening.
          <p class="context-desc">Picture Carl Rogers in a cozy room, leaning in with gentle eyes, echoing your words like ripples on a still pond: “So you’re feeling…” Through his simple act of reflection, your own story finds its true voice and you discover that your unique struggle touches the heart of human experience.</p>
          <p class="context-desc">Today, that same warmth guides conversations from therapy chairs to team meetings. By truly hearing another—and by daring to share our own truths—we weave a shared tapestry of understanding, reminding us that in every personal tale lies the thread that binds us all.</p>
          <p class="context-desc2"><i>If you’re struggling with mental health, contact your local authority or crisis services. Please do not share personal or sensitive information.</i></p>
        {% elif bot == 'logical' %}
          “Logic is the anatomy of thought.”<br>Test your reasoning clearly and calmly.
          <p class="context-desc">Envision Aristotle in his Lyceum, dissecting ideas with the precision of a scalpel: “Does this premise hold?” “Where does this inference lead?” Through his calm examination, each argument reveals its inner structure, laying bare the pathways of sound judgment.</p>
          <p class="context-desc">Today, that same clarity guides debates in boardrooms and debates in daily life. By examining our assumptions and tracing each step of our reasoning, we build ideas as sturdy as well-crafted bridges—ensuring our conclusions stand firm under scrutiny.</p>
          <p class="context-desc2"><i>If you’re struggling with mental health, contact your local authority or crisis services. Please do not share personal or sensitive information.</i></p>
        {% elif bot == 'creative' %}
          Help your own thoughts come to life through gentle guidance.
          <p class="context-desc">Imagine you’re about to sketch a vibrant community mural and you call on your creative sparring partner. They fire off the opening question: “What story should this wall whisper to passersby?”
          <p class="context-desc">This electric, question-driven dance works wonders for every spark of inspiration.
