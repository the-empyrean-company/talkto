# TalkTo

**TalkTo** is an experimental web app that explores how conversation can relieve suffering, clarify thoughts, and foster insight.

Since the earliest days of humanity, we’ve known that talking helps. From storytelling around the fire to the development of modern psychotherapy, conversation has always been a tool for healing and understanding. **TalkTo** builds on this legacy.

## 🧠 What It Does

TalkTo offers a variety of AI-powered conversation partners, each inspired by distinct traditions of dialogue—philosophical, therapeutic, pragmatic, and more. These personas are designed to help you think out loud, reflect deeply, and find clarity through dialogue.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Built using the **OpenAI API**
- Models conversation styles from ancient and modern traditions
- Aims to support users in gathering their thoughts, reflecting, and making sense of complex emotions or ideas

## 🌍 Why We Built This

This project started as an indie hacking experiment: could we create a digital conversation partner that *feels* like talking to a thoughtful other? Can AI help us think better—not by giving us answers, but by asking the right questions?

## 🚀 Roadmap

- [x] Initial prototype with basic personas
- [ ] Launch as a lightweight web app for public testing
- [ ] Gather user feedback and assess usefulness
- [ ] Expand into a more full-fledged application depending on traction

## 🧪 Try It Yourself

Coming soon. Stay tuned.
